# New York City Property Sales

### Overview
I was in the mood to explore some data... So naturally I looked to Kaggle for an interesting dataset. I found a dataset on [New York City Property Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/new-york-city/nyc-property-sales/discussion/42383?resource=download) and started writing a variety of SQL queries so I could start understanding the data.

I love New York and always hear about the high costs of rent, so I was interested in how the cost of buying property in NYC would differ and if there were certain variables that would affect it.

This data is from September 2016 through September 2017, so it's not super recent if you were to apply it now, but I still found some great insights on property sales and enjoyed exploring the data.
